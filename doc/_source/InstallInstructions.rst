Installation Instructions
*************************

* Install ridgeback and multi-ridgeback packages:
  
  * Install the ridgeback simulation and navigation packages by clearpath robotics using the bash commands in the terminal. 
    
    .. code-block:: console
       
       sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-ridgeback-simulator ros-melodic-ridgeback-desktop ros-melodic-ridgeback-navigation
    
    To learn about using these packages check out the `tutorials`_ by Clearpath Robotics.

    .. _tutorials: <http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/assets/guides/kinetic/ridgeback/simulation.html>

  * Install rospackage for teleoperation from terminal.

  * Clone the multi_ridgeback_gazebo ROS package into the src directory of your catkin_ws and run catkin_make from the root of your catkin_ws.

    .. code-block:: console
       
       mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
       cd ~/catkin_ws/src
       git clone https://contact/n.n.nagda@tudelft.nl/for/access.git 
       cd ..
       catkin_make

  * .. note::
       
       To confirm the installation uptil this point, run the following roslaunch command in a terminal. 
       
       .. code-block:: console
          
          roslaunch multi_ridgeback_gazebo multi_ridgeback_world.launch

       This should launch a gazebo simulation with 2 ridgebacks that can be teleoperated using the teleop nodes running in the launched terminals. 
       Also, an instance of Rviz is launched, wherein you can visualize their laserscans and the TF tree.   

  * Clone the multi_ridgeback_nav ROS package into the src directory of your catkin_ws and run catkin_make from the root of your catkin_ws.
    
    .. code-block:: console
       
       cd ~/catkin_ws/src
       git clone https://contact/n.n.nagda@tudelft.nl/for/access.git 
       cd ..
       catkin_make

  * .. note::
       
       To confirm the installation uptil this point, run the following roslaunch command in a terminal. 
       
       .. code-block:: console
          
          roslaunch multi_ridgeback_nav multi_ridgeback_nav.launch

       This should launch a gazebo simulation with 3 ridgebacks and an instance of Rviz to issue navigation goals. 
       Additionally terminals are also launched to manually operate the robot if it is stuck. 
       The 3 ridgebacks have IDs as rdg01 rdg02 and rdg03 respectively and their nodes and topics are live under those namespaces respectively.
       The 2d Nav Goal tool from the tool ribbon can be used to issue navigation goals to the respective robot by setting the current topic name for it in the tool properties.

            - |rviz_toolp2|
            - |rviz_toolp3|
          * - Right click on 2D Nav Goal tool and click on tool properties
            - Click the 2D Nav Goal topic
            - Set the correct robot ID in the 2D Nav Goal topic base namespace 
          
* Install sfm_pmdm package including dependencies

  * Installing dependency libraries
  
    .. code-block:: console

       sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libarpack2-dev libsuperlu-dev
    
  * Installing Armadillo C++ library

  * Clone obstacle_detector package into catkin workspace and catkin_make.

  * Install pygame

    .. code-block:: console
